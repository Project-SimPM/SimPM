why it shows a zero in statistics for activity-3 in probabilistc cpm example while such thing is not 
When we run simulation for a number of times like what we have in probabilistic CPM. So it should show us the logs for all of the runs if we select all of the runs in the dashboard. And if we select a specific run it should show the logs for that specific run only. So right now it only shows the logs for the last round, like for the probabilistic CPM it shows the run. For #200 I want it to be for all. Runs and the number of entities and the number of resources and things should be also updated according to the run chosen. So if we choose all runs, it makes sense to show all the entities that are created through all the runs. So in this case for probabilistic CPM it would be like. 200 entities, that's fine. Or 1400 and it is whatever it is but for the. For the. When we select the specific Quran, it should show only the seven entities that are in that specific run. So please update my codes to reflect that and give me a proper dashboard related to. All runs or specific runs as we would like and select in the dashboard
