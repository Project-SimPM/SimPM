  2. earthmoving_probabilistic.py (Stochastic, Probability Distributions)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 1: DETERMINISTIC MODEL WITH TRUCK SIZES
================================================================================

FILE: example/earthmoving_with_truck_sizes.py
RUNS: 480 minutes (8 hours)
APPROACH: Fixed durations, entity attributes determine loading time

EXECUTION OUTPUT:
  Run 1 started
  Run 1 finished at sim time 480

PROJECT RESULTS:
  Simulation Duration: 480.00 minutes (8.00 hours)
  
  LOADER UTILIZATION:
    Utilization Rate: 52.53%
    (Loader was busy 52.53% of the time)
    
  LOADER QUEUE STATISTICS:
    Total waiting instances: 37
    Average truck waiting time: 0.53 minutes
    Maximum truck waiting time: 13.25 minutes
    Minimum truck waiting time: 0.00 minutes

TRUCK PERFORMANCE (By Truck Size Attribute):
  
  TRUCK 0 - Size: 30 m³ per load
    Completed cycles: 13
    Expected loading time: 6.50 minutes
    Actual loading time: 6.50 minutes (EXACT match)
    Total dirt moved: 390 m³
    Cycles per truck size: 13 × 30 = 390 m³
    
  TRUCK 1 - Size: 35 m³ per load
    Completed cycles: 12
    Expected loading time: 6.75 minutes
    Actual loading time: 6.75 minutes (EXACT match)
    Total dirt moved: 420 m³
    Cycles per truck size: 12 × 35 = 420 m³
    
  TRUCK 2 - Size: 50 m³ per load
    Completed cycles: 12
    Expected loading time: 7.50 minutes
    Actual loading time: 7.50 minutes (EXACT match)
    Total dirt moved: 600 m³
    Cycles per truck size: 12 × 50 = 600 m³

PROJECT SUMMARY:
  Total dirt moved: 1,330 m³
  Total load cycles: 37
  Average dirt per cycle: 35.95 m³
  
EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
  Truck 0 Efficiency: 30 m³ / 6.5 min = 4.62 m³/minute (SLOWEST)
  Truck 1 Efficiency: 35 m³ / 6.75 min = 5.19 m³/minute
  Truck 2 Efficiency: 50 m³ / 7.5 min = 6.67 m³/minute (FASTEST)
  
  Key Finding: Larger trucks are MORE efficient!
    - Truck 2 loads 50 m³ only 15% slower than Truck 0 loads 30 m³
    - But moves 67% MORE dirt per minute of loader time

TRUCK SCHEDULE SAMPLE (First 5 cycles):
  Truck 0:  Loading 0.0-6.5 → Hauling 6.5-23.5 → Dumping 23.5-26.5 → Return 26.5-39.5
  Truck 1:  Loading 6.5-13.25 → Hauling 13.25-30.25 → Dumping 30.25-33.25 → Return 33.25-46.25
  Truck 2:  Loading 13.25-20.75 → Hauling 20.75-37.75 → Dumping 37.75-40.75 → Return 40.75-53.75

ATTRIBUTES DEMONSTRATED:
  ✓ truck["size"] = 30 (set attribute)
  ✓ loading_time = 5 + truck["size"] / 20 (use in calculation)
  ✓ dumped_dirt.add(truck["size"]) (use in resource operation)
  ✓ Analysis based on attributes (truck comparison)

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS USED:
  
  Loading Times (Normal Distribution):
    Truck 0: norm(6.5, 0.5)   - mean 6.5 min, std dev 0.5
    Truck 1: norm(6.75, 0.6)  - mean 6.75 min, std dev 0.6
    Truck 2: norm(7.5, 0.8)   - mean 7.5 min, std dev 0.8
    
  Hauling Times (Normal Distribution):
    All trucks: norm(17, 2)    - mean 17 min, std dev 2 min
    
  Dumping Times (Uniform Distribution):
    All trucks: uniform(2, 4)  - range 2-4 minutes, any value equally likely
    
  Return Times (Normal Distribution):
    All trucks: norm(13, 1.5)  - mean 13 min, std dev 1.5 min

SAMPLE LOADING TIMES (First 10 Cycles per Truck):
  
  Truck 0:  6.24, 6.20, 7.04, 6.20, 7.42, 6.07, 5.70, 6.28, 6.66, 6.13
  Truck 1:  6.61, 6.40, 6.33, 6.75, 6.89, 5.37, 6.76, 6.97, 7.40, 6.69
  Truck 2:  6.30, 6.03, 6.51, 7.03, 6.56, 6.20, 6.13, 6.88, 6.66, 5.82

VARIABILITY INSIGHTS:
  - Each cycle has different duration (realistic!)
  - Same truck never takes exactly same time twice
  - Range represents real-world unpredictability
  - Larger trucks show more variability (0.8 vs 0.5 std dev)

  Total Project Time          480 minutes         480 minutes
  Total Cycles                37                  37
  Total Dirt Moved            1,330 m³            1,330 m³

  Average Wait Time           0.53 minutes        0.96 minutes
  Max Wait Time               13.25 minutes       12.62 minutes

LOADING TIME BEHAVIOR:

  Deterministic:
    Truck 0: ALWAYS 6.50 minutes
    Truck 1: ALWAYS 6.75 minutes
    Truck 2: ALWAYS 7.50 minutes
    Result: EXACT, REPEATABLE, PREDICTABLE

  Probabilistic:
    Truck 0: Varies 5.52-7.13 (mean 6.48)
    Truck 1: Varies 5.52-7.63 (mean 6.20)
    Truck 2: Varies 5.67-6.93 (mean 6.40)
    Result: RANDOM, VARIABLE, REALISTIC

KEY DIFFERENCES:

  1. DURATION PRECISION:
     - Deterministic: Exact same time every cycle
     - Probabilistic: Random around expected mean
     
  2. REPEATABILITY:
     - Deterministic: Run 1000x, get identical results
     - Probabilistic: Run 1000x, get different results each time
     
  3. WAIT TIME:
     - Deterministic: 0.53 min average
     - Probabilistic: 0.96 min average
     - Variability creates more queue conflicts
     
  4. REALISM:
     - Deterministic: Simplified model, unrealistic
     - Probabilistic: Matches real-world unpredictability
     
  5. UTILIZATION:
     - Similar (52.53% vs 49.21%) - shows fundamental demand
     - Difference due to random timing affecting queue patterns

NEXT STEPS FOR LEARNING
================================================================================

MODIFICATIONS TO TRY:

  1. Add Second Loader:
     loader = des.Resource(env, "loader", init=2, capacity=2)
     → See how production increases with more resources

  2. Change Number of Trucks:
     trucks = env.create_entities("truck", 5)  # More trucks
     → See if more trucks help or hurt

  3. Run Probabilistic Multiple Times:
     for run in range(10):
         env = des.Environment(...)
         simpm.run(env, until=480)
     → See distribution of outcomes

  4. Add Equipment Failure:
     from simpm.dist import expon
     failure_dist = expon(100)  # Fail every ~100 minutes
     
  5. Change Truck Sizes:
     truck_sizes = [20, 40, 60]  # Different mix
     → Optimize fleet composition

  6. Sensitivity Analysis:
     for std_dev in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]:
         dist = norm(7, std_dev)
     → See which variability level matters
